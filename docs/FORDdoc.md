FEST-3D (Finite-volume Explicit STructured 3-Dimensional) is computational fluid dynamic solver written in Fortran 90 for solving the Navier-Stokes equations on structured grids using state-of-the-art finite-volume  methods. It is a modular, multiblock, finite-volume code developed to solve flow problems  in the field of aerodynamics.

## Installation
For installation instructions check out the [Documentation](./page/01_install.html) guide.

## Steps to run FEST-3D 
For detailed documentation on steps to run the FEST-3D after downlaod and installation, check out "[How to run FEST-3D](./page/04_Steps_to_run_FEST3D.html)" page.

## Tutorials
For tutorials check out the [test_case](./page/05_tutorials/index.html) descriptions.

@note
There are two separate GitHub repositories:<br>
1. <a href="https://github.com/FEST3D/FEST-3D" target="_blank">FEST-3D<a> directory, which contains the source code<br>
2. <a href="https://github.com/FEST3D/run" target="_blank">Run</a> directory, which contains the tutorials<br>
The run directory is a submodule of the FEST-3D code.

## Modules and Subroutines
Although most of modules and subroutines are named such that its purpose is clear from its name, still more information is provided in [source File](./lists/files.html) and [Modules](./lists/modules.html) pages. Documentation of FEST-3D uses [Ford documentation generator](https://github.com/Fortran-FOSS-Programmers/ford) which generates documentation using the special comments written for each subroutine and module.

@Bug

  - Halt/Stop condition does not work on MPI
  - Can not run turbulent flow simulation on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) due to outdated OS and libraries used by WSL.

@endbug

@todo
Add HLLC and Roe flux difference Schemes
