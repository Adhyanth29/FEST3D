## Getting Started
In order to understand better that how to use different options in FEST-3D,
some verification test cases are provided as tutorials.

## Summary of Testcases
 * Supersonic inviscid flow over a ramp (2D)
 * Subsonic inviscid flow over a smooth bump (2D)
 * Lid-driven cavity (2D)
 * Laminar flow over a plate (2D)
 * Turbulent flow over a plate  (2D)
 * Turbulent flow over a transonic airfoil RAE-2822 (2D)
 * Transition flow over a flat plate (2D)
